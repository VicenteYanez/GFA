# GNSS Field Analysis (GFA)

My name is Vicente Yañez and I'm a geologist interested in computer science. GFA is a compilation of python's functions that I wrote for my internship in [Centro Sismológico Nacional](http://www.sismologia.cl/) (CSN) and during my undergraduate thesis (spanish).

GFA have the functions to calculate vectors from a gnss time series data (from the trajectory model of Bevis & Brown, 2014 or from a simple lineal fitting) and with this, obtain a velocity field that represent the cortical deformation. After, from the velocity field this program include the tools to calculate the velocity tensor, and from this, the vorticity and stretching tensors (from the equation of Davis & Titus, 2011).

I'm sorry if you read any misspells o grammatical error. English isn't my mother tongue and my skills in it is far from perfect.
