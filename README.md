# GNSS Field Analysis (GFA)

My name is Vicente Yañez and I'm a geologist interested in computer science. GFA is a compilation of python's functions that I wrote for my internship in [Centro Sismológico Nacional](http://www.sismologia.cl/) (CSN) and during my undergraduate thesis (spanish).

GFA have the functions to calculate vectors from a gnss time series data (from the trajectory model of [Bevis & Brown, 2014](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00190-013-0685-5) or from a simple lineal fitting) and with this, obtain a velocity field that represent the cortical deformation. After, from the velocity field this program include the tools to calculate the velocity tensor, and from this, the vorticity and stretching tensors (from the equations of [Davis & Titus, 2011](http://www.joshuadavis.us/teaching/2013fcomps/davistitus2011.pdf)).

To start using GFA, you should see the wiki page [How to start](https://github.com/VicenteYanez/GFA/wiki/How-to-start)

I'm sorry if you read any misspells o grammatical error. English is my second lenguage and my skills in it is far from perfect.
